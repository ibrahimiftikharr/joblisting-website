# joblisting-website
The project is a job portal where users can either sign up as employers or job seekers. Employers can post jobs, update or delete them, and view all their posted jobs. Job seekers can view available jobs, apply for them, manage their applications, and create or update their CVs. The system uses JWT tokens for authentication.
